# Pizza Sales Dashboard Project
## Overview
This is my first dashboard project, which I created to practice my analysis and visualization skills by utilizing SQL queries to uncover key performance indicators (KPI) and other user requirements, and then visualizing an interactive dashboard with Power BI to support business users in making data-driven decisions.
## Tools 
- Microsoft SQL server
- SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
- Microsoft Excel
- Power BI Desktop
## Dataset
The dataset that I used in this project is from Kaggle: Pizza Sales Dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nextmillionaire/pizza-sales-dataset
## KPIs & Chart Requirements
### KPIs
- Total revenue
- Average order value
- Total pizzas sold
- Total orders
- Average pizzas per order
### Chart Requirements
 - Daily trend for total orders
 - Monthly trend for total orders
 - Percent of sales by pizza category
 - Percent of sales by pizza size
 - Total pizzas sold by pizza category
 - Top & Bottom 5 pizzas by revenue
 - Top & Bottom 5 pizzas by quantity
 - Top & Bottom 5 pizzas by total orders

## Steps in project
### 1.Setting up Microsoft SQL server
- Use SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to connect to my Microsoft SQL Server.
- Create new Database for this project.
- Import table from csv file.
### 2.SQL Queries
- Query the results of KPIs and Chart requirements by using SQL to make sure that the data we use in the dashboard is correct.
### 3.Create Dashboard
- Connect PowerBI to Microsoft SQL Server as a data source.
- Import the data and then transform it by using Power Query.
- Create the necessary measures.
- Visualization of KPIs and charts based on requirements.Â 
- Create a filter for business users to interact with the dashboard.
- Check the results from our SQL queries to make sure that the result we got is the same.
### 4.Analysis to find insights.
- Identify the top 5 pizzas that we should prepare to increase the number of ingredients in our stock.
- Identify the top 5 pizzas for which we should make some promotions or discounts to attract our customers.
- Found that the most-sold pizzas are in the classic category, so we should add more pizzas in this category in the future to increase our revenue.
- Found that the busiest days are on Friday and the busiest months are in July, so we can prepare, such as by increasing our staff and stock.
